# mynotes
Django project for teaching the basics of Django projects.

## Steps as branches:
* step1: browser shows "Hello, World". No models, no db, no templates.
* step2: models created, db migration done, new template *home.html*.
* step3: static/css added, tests begun.
* step4: create new topic implemented, the form done manually (no validation).
* step5: forms.modelForm taken into use, validation ok, error messages made nice.
* step6: edit and delete topic implemented -> CRUD ok for topic (tests ok). Signup, login and logout ok.
* step7: CRUD of notes ok. Basic implementation, no tests.

## TODO:
* managing personal details (user)
* ameliorate usability and looks
